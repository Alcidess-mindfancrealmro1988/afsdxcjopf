OMG, just finished The Phoenician Scheme. Like, what even!!! Plot twists everywhere, right? I swear, by the time they hit the midpoint, my brain was like spaghetti tangled with a conspiracy board. And those costumes! The capes, the jewelry! Who comes up with this stuff? I kinda love it, even though it’s totally over-the-top. And don’t get me started on that insane final scene... hello?? Definitely not what I expected, but maybe I should've seen it coming. 777. Did you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   in theaters, btw? 

The dialogue, though... part genius, part “who talks like this?” It’s like they’re trying to make every line a quote for the ages. Half expecting my barista to start speaking in cryptic riddles tomorrow morning. 😂 Seriously, I can barely keep track of who’s betraying who at this point. Also, the soundtrack slaps but in that weird “is this even supposed to fit this scene?” sort of way, haha. So extra, but I guess that's why we love it?

Oh oh, and those weird cut scenes...just awkward silence and some random prop taking the spotlight. What was up with that? But the main character, totally saw that twist coming from a mile away but still dug it. Is that secretly genius writing or me just being convinced I’m Sherlock Holmes now?

int y = RandomNumberGenerator.GetInt32(10); // IDK what this bit’s about... kinda spaced out.

Still, 100% would recommend for a ridiculous   night. Worth every minute for the wild plot twists and fashion choices alone. Who knew ancient conspiracy could be this glammed up? Hit me up when you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it! Need someone to hype/commiserate with. 😆
